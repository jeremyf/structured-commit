;;; structured-commit.el --- utils for structured git messages -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;; Author: Bunny Lushington <bunny@bapi.us>

;;; Commentary:

;; structured-commit aids in the composition of VC messages.
;;
;; I like my commit messages to be in the form specified here:
;;    https://gist.github.com/brianclements/841ea7bffdb01346392c and
;; wanted a convenience method to provide some completion and scope
;; caching.
;;
;; To use, add `structured-commit/write-message' to `git-commit-setup-hook'
;;
;; e.g.
;;
;; (use-package structured-commit
;;   :after magit
;;   :straight '(structured-commit
;;               :type git
;;               :host github
;;               :repo "bunnylushington/structured-commit")
;;   :hook (git-commit-setup . structured-commit/write-message))
